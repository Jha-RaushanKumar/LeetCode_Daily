Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

-1000 <= a, b <= 1000



class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {

    /*
    while b!=0
        do a&b which gives 1 if last bit is 1
        a=a^b;
        left shift c by 1 and store in b
    */    
    while(b!=0){
            int c = a&b;
            a=a^b;
            b=c<<1;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
